## AIM

I have here aimed  to list data of nmbers of covid-19. 
I used AXIOS library to fetch the data. 
I used [Geolocation API](https://geolocation-db.com/json/0f761a30-fe14-11e9-b59f-e53803842572) to get the location of user.
I used [Material UI] for the styling.
I used useContext to pass props.
I used marquee slider to make slider in the bottom of the page.
